Data analysis project using SQL tool and data visualization using Tableau tool Data about students in college 
This data aims to predict whether students will continue to go to college or not.

downloaded the dataset from the Kaggel website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saddamazyazy/go-to-college-dataset)
It is synthetic data created for a college project.
After that, we created a database in SQL server and inserted the data set as a table.

And then we did the cleaning procedures, adding columns and deleting columns that were not necessary.

Then we query the data to show if the students will continue to go to college or not.

And then we extracted the data as Excel tables.

And then we loaded the tables in Tableau to make some visualizations over the data.
